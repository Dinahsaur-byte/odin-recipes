# odin-recipes
A recipe website I'm creating for practice as part of the Odin Project.
This project will demonstrate what I've learned in the past sections about HTML as well as the command line, since every file and transfer will be done using the command line.
As for HTML, this will include setting up an HTML boilerplate, using headers and paragraphs, links, images, and proper file organization.
